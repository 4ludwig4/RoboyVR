Use Cases
=========

**NOTICE: THIS CODE IS NOT BEING MAINTAINED AS OF NOW**

The following use cases should demonstrate how the Unity side of BeRoboy deals with certain scenarios,
it should show further which procedure calls are happening in the scene, that a developer
needs to be aware of.

Switching between views
-----------------------

.. figure:: images/usecase_view_selection.*
   :align: center
   :alt: Usecase view Selection
         
   The user first switches to the simulation view, but gets all exhausted and switches to
   the relaxing observer view mode.
