Troubleshooting
---------------

If gazebo encounters problems loading the Model into the world or starting the server,
these commands could be useful.

1. Kill the gazebo server and restart it.

.. code:: bash

  killall gzserver
  killall gzclient

2. Export the gazebo paths to the model

.. code:: bash

  source /usr/share/gazebo-7/setup.sh
  export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/roboy-ros-control/src/roboy_models:$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH
