   BeRoboy™ is the next thing in the world of virtual reality robots.
   
   

**What is it?**

BeRoboy™ is taking the RoboyVR experience to the next level. With the help of seamless full body tracking
the user can send commands to Roboy, take control over Roboy and become THE Roboy. BeRoboy™ puts the user
in the driver seat and provides a fully immersive experience like never before. With BeRoboy™ you can
control various different versions of Roboy. This includes a Roboy in VR, in a gazebo simulation and even
the real one. You want Roboy to throw a punch, shake a leg or make obscene gestures? BeRoboy™ lets you do
all of that and a lot more!



**How does it work?**

BeRoboy™ is utilizing the full capabilities of HTC's Vive headset and lighthouse tracking to accurately
capture the user's pose. This data is then converted to determine the positions and rotations Roboy needs
to adopt. Corresponding commands are then send in a format that Roboy understands and which he is able to
process. After receiving those messages Roboy changes its state/ pose/ etc. When the user establishes a
link with the gazebo Roboy or the real one, BeRoboy™ provides video/ camera streems from the respective
environment. This serves the purpose to give the user feedback in what way his actions affect the connected
version of Roboy.
