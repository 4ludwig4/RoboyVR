   BeRoboy is the next step in the world of virtual reality robots.
   

What is it?
-----------

BeRoboy is designed to allow the user to be in charge of Roboy and experience the world and virtual environment through his eyes. With BeRoboy you can control various different versions of Roboy. This includes a Roboy in VR, in a gazebo simulation and even the real one. The user can make Roboy move, jump'n'jive, rock'n'roll and more!

How does it work?
-----------------

BeRoboy is utilizing the full capabilities of HTC's Vive headset and lighthouse tracking to accurately capture the user's pose. This data is then converted to determine the positions and rotations Roboy needs to adopt. Corresponding commands are then send in a format that Roboy understands and which he is able to process. After receiving those messages Roboy changes its state/ pose/ etc. When the user establishes a link with either simulated or real Roboy, BeRoboy provides video/ camera streems from the respective
environment. This serves the purpose to give the user feedback in what way his actions affect the surroundings of Roboy.
