Controllers
===========

Two different controller types exist: One controller option is used as a tool for pointing and interacting with different objcets in the scene, while the second controller option is dedicated to different modes, providing the option to change modes and apply further settings in each mode. 

The initial setup enables the user to choose which type of controller to have left and right, respectively.
