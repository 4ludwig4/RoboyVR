   Press down on the touchpad to teleport to a specific position.
   
Using the touchpad of the designated controller as a button and pressing down the lower end of it, the teleporting option becomes visible. By holding and pointing the controller around in space, the destination can be determined. In case the position is not possible, e.g. if it is outside the cave, it cannot be selected. If the spot is a valid destination, the user is spawned to this position as soon as he or she releases the touchpa. 

Teleporting in a bit buggy as of now, the navigation mesh is in need of an update as we increased the scale on our VR cave. This was done to give the user more space to insert additional models in the environment.
