Teleporting
===========

Teleporting in the master scene (which represents all core features) is also a bit buggy until now, the navigation
mesh would need an update as we increased the scale on our VR cave. This was done to give the user more space to
insert additional models in the environment. Shooting only works with one model in the scene, e.g. the same one where
also the pose subscribing works.
