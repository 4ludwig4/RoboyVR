Current State
=============

Up until now the project has come a long way, many tools have been implemented to play around
with Roboy and it's environment. The core features provide various functions for the user. One
of the main abilities of the VR experience is BeRoboy, where the user gets the chance to control
Roboy. As of now only virtual Roboys can be manipulated and controlled which are serving as subjects
in the gazebo simulation. In the future it is planned to control also the real counterparts of Roboy.

Besides controlling Roboy it is possible to insert and remove numerous models from the virtual world
simply by point and click. For this purpose we designed and implemented a seperate tool which you can
selected from the left hand controller (selectionwheel is activated by the `gripped <images/controller_layout.*>`_ button).
