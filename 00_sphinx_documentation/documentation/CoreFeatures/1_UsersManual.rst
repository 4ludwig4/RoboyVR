User's Manual
=============
This manual will descripe the steps required to start BeRoboyâ„¢ and begin your journey.

Starting Gazebo
---------------
Start your Ubuntu machine and open a terminal.

1. Source the setup.bash

.. code:: bash

  source /path-to-roboy-ros-control/devel/setup.bash
  
2. Start the launch file which starts Gazebo with the Roboy and a Camera ROS node

.. code:: bash

  roslaunch roboy_simulation roboy_camera.launch  

If yout want the insert/remove feature to work, also launch this in a seperate terminal,
source the same path as before though.

.. code:: bash

  rosrun roboy_simulation VRRoboy  


Starting Unity
--------------
1. Start the unity project inside the git repo you cloned to your hard drive.
2. Inside unity select the RoboyVR scene.
3. In the ROSBridge (located in the hierarchy) type in the correct IP of your Ubuntu machine.

.. figure:: ../images/rosbridge.*
    :align: center
    :alt: ROS Bridge

4. Start the scene.
5. SteamVR should also start, if this throws errors (like "SteamVR unresponsive, not working, etc."), simply restart it.


.. figure:: ../images/steamvr_error.*
    :align: center
    :alt: SteamVR Error

6. When the scene starts properly, you can choose which controller should hold which tools.

.. figure:: ../images/controller_selection_2.*
    :align: center
    :alt: Controller Selection

7. After the controller assignment, you can switch between various view modes via a selection menu in the scene.

.. figure:: images/view_selection_pointing.*
    :align: center
    :alt: View Selection

8. Enjoy your stay!


View Scenarios
--------------
You can choose between the following four view scenarios, each of them offering different things to explore!

**I. Gazebo Simulation**

.. figure:: images/beroboy_simulation.*
   :align: center
   :alt: Simulation view
         
   Take control over the simulation Roboy and see what he does in gazebo.

**II. Real Roboy (ZED)**
 
.. figure:: images/beroboy_z3d.*
   :align: center
   :alt: ZED view
         
   Look through the eyes of the real Roboy and control him in real life.

**III. Observing Gentleman**
   
.. figure:: images/beroboy_observer.*
   :align: center
   :alt: Observer view
         
   Sit back, relax, take a look at Roboy from a safe distance and watch him do some stuff.
   
**IV. VR Roboy**
   
.. figure:: images/beroboy_vr.*
   :align: center
   :alt: VR view
         
   Slip into the role of the true VR Roboy, cause mayhem or look cute, you decide.
