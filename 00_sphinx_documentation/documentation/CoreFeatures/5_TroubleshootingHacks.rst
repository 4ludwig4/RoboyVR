Troubleshooting Hacks
=====================

If the HTC Vive headset isn't working at all:

  - Simple USB-Trick: Unplug the usb cable connecting the htc box with the pc you are using. Simply plug it in the same port. Restart SteamVr.
  - Advanced USB-Trick: Unplug everything from the htc box and using another USB port plug all cables in, this makes it so drivers are installed again.
  - Restart the HTC Vive through the SteamVR settings (developer).

If there are problems with tracking:

  - Make sure the lighthouses can both see each other and at least one of them can see the headset at any point in time.
  - If controllers aren't tracked make sure their batteries are charged. You can also sync them manually by right clicking on one of them in SteamVR.
  - If the tracking is off or doesn't work at all, try doing the SteamVR room setup.
