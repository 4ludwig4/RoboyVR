What is it?
-----------

The Model Updater is a convinient Unity Editor extension, where you can download new models or update existing ones to use in RoboyVR



How does it work?
-----------------

After a short setup, where you have to select the blender.exe and set the github_repo path, you can scan the Github Repository for models.
Now a list of found models appears and you can select, which you want to download.
Pressing "Download" loads the models and additionally converts them with blender to .fbx, so you can use them in Unity. 
Because the models are downloaded into the Assets folder of the Unity project, they will automatically be imported into unity.
Afterwards you just have to press "Create Prefab" and the model will be saved as a prefab, which you can easily just drag and drop into the VR scene.
