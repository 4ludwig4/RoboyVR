**How it works:**  
Roboy and its behavior is simulated on the virtual machine via ROS. Important information  
regarding roboy's movement are then sent through a ROSbridge(e.g. messages) towards Unity.  
In Unity roboy is rendered and constantly updated concerning positions, rotations, etc.  
With the help of a VR-Headset you can watch roboy move around in a virtual space.
